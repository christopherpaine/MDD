#import Annuity_Functions.py


#call a single function within the Annuity_functions.py in order to return the result ....  by feeding in the 2 parameters
#i.e. dataframe and int rate (param2)


#loop calling our function within Annuity_functions.py
#first it should send the original dataset  i.e. ages 17 all the way to 120
#then send the original dataset less the first row i.e ages 18 all the way to 120
#the loop should then do 19 to 120
#20 to 120
#21 to 120
#and so on....




#the final result should be a NEW dataframe within the Repeatedly_Calling_AF.py script  that is printed to the console....


#the first few results will look as follows:

#Age x      result
#17			22.363192005021
#18			22.2756473
#19			22.18044237
